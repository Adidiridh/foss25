# # 🌟 Hand gestured vehicle car using arduino 

## 🚀 Description
The project aims to create a vehicle car that can be controlled using hand gestures. This is achieved by using an Arduino microcontroller to process data from a sensor that detects hand movements. The Arduino then sends signals to the car's motors, which control its movement.

Components:

Arduino microcontroller: This is the brains of the project. It processes data from the sensor and sends signals to the motors.
Sensor: This device detects hand movements. There are several types of sensors that can be used for this purpose, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and ultrasonic sensors.
Motors: These devices control the movement of the car.
Vehicle car: This is the car that will be controlled by hand gestures.

## 🏗️ Coding language and software - 
C++ coding language  which we used here and software is Arduino IDE.


## 🏃‍♂️Benefits:-
.Hands-free control: This project allows for hands-free control of a vehicle car.
.Increased safety: This can potentially increase safety by allowing drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.
.Improved accessibility: This can potentially improve accessibility for people with disabilities.

## 🏃‍♂️ Potential applications :-
.Self-driving cars: This technology could be used in self-driving cars to allow passengers to control the car with hand gestures.
.Robotics: This technology could be used in robotics to allow robots to be controlled with hand gestures.
.Gaming: This technology could be used in gaming to allow players to control characters with hand gestures.

Conclusion:
This project provides a brief overview of a project that uses hand gestures to control a vehicle car with an Arduino. This technology has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as self-driving cars, robotics, and gaming.
